title: Core Concepts
---

Great Expectations is all about helping you understand data better, so you can communicate with your team and others
about what you've built and what you expect. Great Expectations delivers three key features: **expectations validate
data quality**, **tests are docs, and docs are tests**, and **automatic profiling of data**. This guide helps you
understand *how* Great Expectations does that by describing the core concepts used in the tool. The guide aims for
precision, which can sometimes make it a bit dense, so we include examples of common use cases to help build intuition.

Below, you'll find a brief introduction to the big ideas you'll need to understand how Great Expectations works, information
on some of the defining design decisions in the tool, and links to more detailed documentation on concepts.

## Key Ideas

If you only have time to remember a few key ideas about Great Expectations, make them these:

It all starts with `Expectations`. An Expectation is how we communicate the way data *should* appear. It's also how
Profilers communicate what they *learn* about data, and what Data Docs uses to *describe* data or *diagnose* problems.
When lots of Expectations are grouped together to define a kind of data asset, like "monthly taxi rides", we call it
an `Expectation Suite`.

`Datasources` are the first thing you'll need to configure to use Great Expectations. A Datasource brings together a
way of interacting with data (like a database or spark cluster) and some specific data (a description of that taxi ride
data for last month). With a Datasource, you can get a Batch of data or a Validator that can evaluate expectations on
data.

When you're deploying Great Expectations, you'll use a `Checkpoint` to run a validation, testing whether data meets
expectations, and potentially performing other actions like building and saving a Data Docs site, sending a
notification, or signaling a pipeline runner.

Great Expectations makes it possible to maintain state about data pipelines using `Stores`. A Store is a generalized
way of keeping Great Expectations objects, like Expectation Suites, Validation Results, Metrics, Checkpoints, or even
Data Docs sites. Stores, and other configuration, is managed using a `Data Context`. The Data Context configuration is
usually stored as a yaml file or declared in your pipeline directly, and you should commit the configuration to version
control to share it with your team.

## Design Decisions


Great Expectations is designed to help you think and communicate clearly about your data. To do that, we need to rely on
some specific ideas about *what* we're protecting. You usually do not need to think about these nuances to use Great
Expectations, and many users never think about what *exactly* makes a Data Asset or Batch. But we think it can be
extremely useful to understand the design decisions that guide Great Expectations.

Great Expectations protects **Data Assets**. A **Data Asset** is a logical collection of records. Great Expectations
consumes and creates **metadata about Data Assets**.

- For example, a Data Asset might be *a user table in a database*, *monthly financial data*, *a collection of event log
  data*, or anything else that your organization uses.

How do you know when a collection of records is *one* Data Asset instead of two Data Assets or when two collections of
records are really part of the same Data Asset? In Great Expectations, we think the answer lies in the user. Great
Expectations opens insights and enhances communication while protecting against pipeline risks and data risks, but that
revolves around a *purpose* in using some data (even if that purpose starts out as "I want to understand what I have
here"!).

We recommend that you call a collection of records a Data Asset when you would like to track metadata (and especially, *
Expectations*) about it. **A collection of records is a Data Asset when it's worth giving it a name.**

Since the purpose is so important for understanding when a collection of records is a Data Asset, it immediately follows
that *Data Assets are not necessarily disjoint*. The same data can be in multiple Data Assets. You may have different
Expectations of the same raw data for different purposes or produce documentation tailored to specific analyses and
users.

- Similarly, it may useful to describe subsets of a Data Asset as new Data Assets. For example, if we have a Data Asset
  called the "user table" in our data warehouse, we might also have a different Data Asset called the "Canadian User
  Table" that includes data only for some users.

Not all records in a Data Asset need to be available at the same time or place. A Data Asset could be built from *
streaming data* that is never stored, *incremental deliveries*, *analytic queries*, *incremental updates*, *replacement
deliveries*, or from a *one-time* snapshot.

That implies that a Data Asset is a **logical** concept. Not all of the records may be **accessible** at the same time.
That highlights a very important and subtle point: no matter where the data comes from originally, Great Expectations
validates **batches** of data. A **batch** is a discrete subset of a Data Asset that can be identified by a some
collection of parameters, like the date of delivery, value of a field, time of validation, or access control
permissions.

- Batches often correspond to deliveries of data or runs of an ETL pipeline, but they do not have to. For example, an
  analyst studying New York City taxi data might take one logical view into the data where each batch is a month's
  delivery. But if the analyst selects data from the dataset based on other criteria for her analysis--the time of the
  ride and number of passengers, for example--then each batch corresponds to the specific query she runs. In that case,
  the Expectations she creates may have more to do with the analysis she is running than aggregate characteristics of
  the taxi data.

In some cases **the thing that "makes a batch a batch" is the act of attending to it--for example by validating or
profiling the data**. It's all about **your** Expectations.
